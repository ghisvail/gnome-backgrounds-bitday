[BitDay], a beautiful dynamic pixel wallpaper, packaged for the GNOME desktop.


## Configuration

The default timings for the dynamic wallpaper were taken from the
[BitDay-for-Windows] configuration. They can be adjusted either in file
`backgrounds/bitday-timed.xml.in` before installation, or in file
`/usr/share/backgrounds/bitday/bitday-timed.xml` post installation.


## Licensing

The BitDay images are released to the public domain (see the UNLICENSE file).
The rest of the codebase is modified from the [gnome-backgrounds] project,
which is licensed under the GPL version 2 or later (see the COPYING file).
